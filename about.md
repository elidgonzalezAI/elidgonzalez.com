# About Me

I'm Eli Gonzalez — a software engineer turned AI-focused cybersecurity consultant. With over 5 years of experience in development, support, and QA, I've pivoted to helping AI-first startups secure their applications and infrastructure.

I'm particularly focused on:
- Prompt injection vulnerabilities in public-facing LLM apps
- Adversarial ML scenarios
- Automating recon and reporting via GPT-4 & LangChain

I believe security shouldn't slow down innovation — it should enable it.
